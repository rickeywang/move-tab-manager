This is a Chrome plug-in to Move the Tab Manager button to top of the left panel in Onshape

To install:

1. Download this repository as a zip file and put all of them in a folder
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer mode
4. "Load unpacked" the folder you downloaded

Note: It is a little janky. Switch between Onshape tabs will make it work if it didn't manage to move the button the first time.
